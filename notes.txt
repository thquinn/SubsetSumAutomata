SSA Observations:
- All of these rules were tested with a 0-200 seed range.
- I skipped most rules where the reward and penalty aren't coprime, since cells not being able to reach some values makes things seem less... "pure," somehow. Also they support more numerical diversity which leads to more complex, alive patterns.
- I theorize that the presence or absence of patterns in a particular rule has something to do with primes. The way they're more common at lower values but still sporadically and (seemingly) unpredictably present in higher ones...

Still to Discover:
- A puffer that leaves oscillators behind

Improvements to WebGL implementation:
- Toggle to restart whenever the whole plane is dead
- Show generation # sincle last restart
- Show population count
- Show highest value

Next Steps for Study:
- Create dependency graphs for some patterns: complex oscillators, simple ships, complex ships.
- Find identical-looking patterns in very different rules and compare the numbers that play the same roles.

+6/8/5: Stable froth.
+6/9/4: "Ships and hubs" setup... not sure if it tends towards extinction. Small starts tend towards methuselahs that spawn a couple different ship types. One cool ship type in particular has three rear sparks. Okay, it doesn't go extinct, but it start to make divergent chunks.

+6/13/7: Stable froth with high-value spikes. Supports ships in sparser starts.
+6/13/10: Stable froth.
+6/13/12: Rare diagonal waves and waveships. Extensible to +6/13+X/12+X, with sporadic rarities as the penalty increases? Similar to +6/12/11 but sufficiently different in the constructions of the patterns.
