# SubsetSumAutomata
A visualizer for a new family of cellular automata

## Notes
* See my writeup of the behavior of these automata and a bunch of cool GIFs [here](https://thquinn.github.io/projects/automaton.html).
* A WebGL implementation by Reddit user pixartist is [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdlfD8).
* The code is crappy. Sorry.
* Use it however you want.
* The gifAnimation library can be kind of annoying to find for Processing 3, so just strip all references to it out if you don't need it.
